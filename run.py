            - Analysis of some dimensions of the SRAG data to explore some of the insights that can be extracted along with the time series provided by the mobility data.
            - Data quality measure to report the missing/wrong data in both datasets
            - Cities clustering experiment to test the ability to classify sucessful or not cases where the protection measures were well implemented to control the disease.
